# thirtythree

A po-33 clone for norns+grid

### differences between thirtythree and the po-33

thirtythree is based in the norns which has much higher sound quality (48khz, 24bit, stereo samples) if thats something you want.

thirtythree has different effects than the po-33. the main reason is that some of the po-33 effects were too advanced for me (like the looping) and also because I wanted to include different effects (like autopan) and also because I wanted to have *stackable* effects (so more than one effect can be triggered simultaneously). 

thirtythree has an effect channel for each sound.

- thirtythree has high fidelity sound (48khz 24bit stereo samples)
- thirtythree uses *stackable* effects (so more than one effect can occur)
